# **Mission to Mars**
## **Purpose**
The purpose of this repository is to upload the scraping,py, app.py, and index.html file component that allows multiple NASA websites related to Mars to be scraped and display information on personal Webapp. 

The major component of ths WebApp is to scrap the latest Mars news and picture, as well as displaying the Mars Facts. 

On top of that, it also display Mars' weather and four different Mars' hemisphere images. 

The background of the website is a tribute to Elon Musk sending his Tesla Roaster into space with a spaceman. I believe it should be in Mars by now. Hopefully the spaceman can find his partner in Mars and spend an eternal life in the new planet.
